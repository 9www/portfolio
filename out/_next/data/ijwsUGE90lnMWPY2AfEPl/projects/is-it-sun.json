Some one will think this is sun, some one is not think it. That depend on the audience how to understand my artwork. <br>Moreover, it have deep meaning in sun artwork, Michel Foucault (He is a philosopher) talking 'Discontinuity', and Foucault's suggest people focus on the 'Discontinuity' while not mainly focus 'Continuity' in the history. And I am agree his point, I want to talking my thinking through this sun artwork. The real sun maybe is not a sun, our real world is not real, like of the Foucault's 'Discontinuity' and 'Continuity', 'Continuity' 's history maybe not a real history, also we maybe need to find a real history in the 'Discontinuity'. <br>In the behind meaning, 'Discontinuity' represent a series of coding, and 'Continuity' represent 'sun'. Finally, I want to explain 'Is_It_Sun' artwork through Foucault's theory. Our eyes see this sun (world) maybe not a real, maybe just a series numbers, maybe we need to find 'real world' in this 'world'.","isImage":0,"media1":{"link":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O8eLSDJKET8"},"media2":{"link":"noImage"}},"__N_SSG":true}
